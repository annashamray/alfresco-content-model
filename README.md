# Alfresco content model

This repository contains the custom content model in Alfresco, intended
to be used with the Open Zaak CMIS-adapter.

Note that this repository is mainly used for (automated) testing purposes.

Open Zaak does not claim or aspire to provide a production-ready Alfresco
setup.
